 * Global modal animations using Angular's animate.leave

 * Usage in templates:
 *   <div animate.leave="modal-backdrop-leave">...</div>
 *   <div animate.leave="modal-leave">...</div>
 * 
 * Note: animate.enter is not used because it applies the starting state
 * and never transitions back, leaving elements invisible.
